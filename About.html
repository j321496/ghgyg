KFC India brings together actor Allu Arjun and the Colonel Sanders in a new film to launch its new offering Peri Peri Launch. On bringing together the Colonel and Arjun for the biggest launch of the season, a KFC India spokesperson stated, “We Indians have an innate knack for all things spice. And when the spice either is such that it makes you tear up or leaves you underwhelmed, it is disappointing. So, who better than KFC along with the superstar himself – Allu Arjun – to present a product with just the right spice.”

“It was great collaborating for KFC’s Peri Peri campaign. Coming together with the OG Colonel Sanders for their new irresistible peri peri sprinkle has been a lovely experience altogether. All I can say isChicken Peri Peri, soooper very very!,” Allu Arjun said on his latest KFC film.

<p2 style="color:black";>Colonel Sanders was a key component of KFC advertising until his death in 1980. Despite his death, Sanders remains a key icon of the company as an "international symbol of hospitality".[114] Early official slogans for the company included "North America's Hospitality Dish" (from 1956) and "We fix Sunday dinner seven nights a week".[115][116] The "finger lickin' good" slogan was used from 1956 and went on to become one of the best-known slogans of the 20th century.[117] The trademark expired in the US in 2006.[118] The first KFC logo was introduced in 1952 and featured a "Kentucky Fried Chicken" typeface and a logo of the Colonel.[119] In 1962, Dave Thomas took Colonel Sanders' bucket and turned it into a sign[120] that revolved in a circular motion in front of almost every American KFC outlet.[121]

Advertising played a key role at KFC after it was sold by Sanders and the company began to advertise on US television with a budget of US$4 million in 1966.[122] In order to fund nationwide advertising campaigns, the Kentucky Fried Chicken Advertising Co-Op was established, giving franchisees 10 votes and the company three when deciding on budgets and campaigns. In 1969, KFC hired its first national advertising agency, Leo Burnett.[23] A notable Burnett campaign in 1972 was the "Get a bucket of chicken, have a barrel of fun" jingle, performed by Barry Manilow.[23] By 1976, KFC was one of the largest advertisers in the US.[123]

In December 2020, KFC revealed the KFConsole, a new gaming console with a "Chicken Chamber" to keep food warm.

Brown Jr. and Jack C. Massey for US$2 million (around US$17 million in 2020).[11] The contract included a lifetime salary for Sanders and the agreement that he would be the company's quality controller and trademark.[27] The chain had reached 3,000 outlets in 48 countries by 1970.[28] In July 1971, Brown sold the company to the Connecticut-based Heublein, a packaged food and drinks corporation, for US$285 million (around US$1.8 billion in 2020).[29] Sanders died in 1980, his promotional work making him a prominent figure in American cultural history.[24] By the time of his death, there were an estimated 6,000 KFC outlets in 48 countries worldwide, with $2 billion worth of sales annually.<img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f8/New_Harrisburg_KFC.jpg/330px-New_Harrisburg_KFC.jpg" height="300"  width="400"/>

In 1982, Heublein was acquired by R. J. Reynolds, the tobacco giant.[23] In July 1986, Reynolds announced the sale of KFC to PepsiCo for $850 million (around US$2.0 billion in 2020).[31] The actual sale took place in early October for $840 million.[32][33] PepsiCo made the chain a part of its restaurants division alongside Pizza Hut and Taco Bell.[34] KFC entered the Chinese market in November 1987, with an outlet in Beijing.[23]

In 1991, the KFC name was officially adopted, although it had already been widely known by that initialism.[35] Kyle Craig, president of KFC U.S., admitted the change was an attempt to distance the chain from the unhealthy connotations of "fried".[36] The early 1990s saw a number of successful major product launches, including spicy "Hot Wings" (launched in 1990), popcorn chicken (1992) and, internationally, the "Zinger", a spicy chicken fillet sandwich (1993).[37] By 1994 KFC had 5,149 outlets in the US and 9,407 overall, with over 100,000 employees.[38] In August 1997, PepsiCo spun off its restaurants division as a public company valued at US$4.5 billion (around US$7.3 billion in 2020)
